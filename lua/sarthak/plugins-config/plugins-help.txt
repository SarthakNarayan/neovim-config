## Treesitter
- TSBufDisable highlight : to disable highlighting
- TSBufEnable highlight : to enable highlighting 
  - Can be mapped to (<leader>rh) so that it can be used if something goes wrong
- TSBufToggle highlight : to toggle highlighting
- If push comes to shove use this ":write | edit | TSBufEnable highlight"

## LSP
- Server Configuration: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md
- If we use LSP without cmp we will have to trigger it ourselves
- <space><space> to show hover documentation, do it again to go inside the documentation, q to quit it
- Important commands
  - LspInfo 
  - LspInstall 
  - LspInstallInfo - For the menu like selection
- When you are installting a language server you are not installing it as a plugin but you are installing a server on your computer
- Sometimes lsp might not work since the root directory doesn't contain the required files. 
  - In my case I was editing a simple js file and only null-ls was being shown as Active lsp this was because my folder didn't have the required directory
    structure like the .gitignore or nodemodules folder etc.
